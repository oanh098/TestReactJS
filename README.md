A user API you can use to display fake user information : https://app.fakejson.com

- For each anime item in the list, display a few informations (like the name, number of episodes, etc).
- When clicking on an Anime Item, a modal will open to show more details about the anime.
- There should be a search field to filter anime by calling the API
- There should be orderBy buttons to sort the list
- There should be a pagination system
- Try separating models, services and views
- Try creating a few Tests
- The app should be responsive
